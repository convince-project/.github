CONVINCE is a project funded by the European Union Horizon Europe Programme ([Grant Agreement N. 101070227](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101070227)). The main contribution is to develop and verify cognitive deliberation capabilities that ensure safe robot operation over extended periods of time without human intervention and integrate these capabilities into a model-driven software toolchain for robot developers. Open-source components of this toolchain will be provided in this GitHub organization. Learn more about what we are doing at [convince-project.eu](https://convince-project.eu/).
